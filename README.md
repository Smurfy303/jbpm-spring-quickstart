# Do Not Use
## Project Not Maintained

This project was originally built as an example of how to use Spring and Hibernate together with jBPM 5.3 during a time when that version of jBPM was in rapid development. It served its purpose at the time, but I no longer provide consulting services related to jBPM and do not maintain this project as a result. I'm leaving it here for posterity, but recommend against its use.

The original README file follows:

## jbpm-spring-quickstart

A sample application, intended to provide a foundation for developers who need to build applications using jBPM 5, Spring, and Hibernate.
